## What is This?

Financial Text Summarizer 3000 is a tool that makes long financial texts shorter and easier to understand. It takes articles about markets, company reports, and financial news and creates quick summaries that capture the important points.

Think of it as your financial reading assistant with a fun retro gaming look!

## Why This Matters in 2025

In today's financial world, we're drowning in information:

- Financial analysts now process 300% more text than in 2020
- The average earnings report has grown to 15,000 words (up from 9,000 in 2020)
- Market-moving information now comes from thousands of sources
- Professionals need to understand complex financial topics quickly

Our tool helps financial professionals save time, avoid information overload, and focus on what really matters in the text.

## How It Works

Financial Text Summarizer 3000 uses several AI techniques to create summaries:

### Extractive Methods (Pulls out important sentences)
- **TextRank**: Finds important sentences using a graph-based ranking
- **LexRank**: Similar to TextRank but considers semantic similarity between sentences
- **LSA**: Uses math to identify key concepts and important sentences
- **TF-IDF**: Ranks sentences based on important terms and how often they appear

### Abstractive Methods (Creates new sentences)
- **BART**: Uses a neural network to generate summaries in its own words
- **T5**: Another AI model that can paraphrase and condense information

The app compares these different methods side-by-side and even measures how good each summary is (if you have a reference summary to compare against).

## Key Features

- **Multiple Input Options**: Use sample texts, paste your own, or upload files
- **Compare Different Methods**: See which summarization technique works best
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure summary quality with ROUGE scores
- **Retro Gaming Look**: Fun, vibrant interface inspired by classic arcade games
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple documents at once
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust summary length and other parameters
